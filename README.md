# Final Project - Proposal

## An elevator pitch of your project (something you can say in less than 1 minute)

The application will be for Steam where we track a users achievements and displays them. We can get these using the Steam API

## The names of the contributors (if you are working with a partner)

None

## A rough list of features (this needs to be large enough to satisfy the "scope" requirements)

The agent will be able to organize games, based on filters

The agent will be able to see which games are installed or uninstalled and pull for all games or just installed 

The agent will be able to update website when user gets an achievement

The agent will be able to pull up videos for achivements to show the user how to get them.


## A list of new things you will need to do to accomplish your project (e.g. websockets)

Will need to learn how to have the AI pull up specific videos to give to the user

Will need to learn how to keep the AI running in background to interactivly mark items as finished.



## Pages/ Views

Each game achivements will be displayed on one template page but there will be tabs to switch between games. If organized in a section the sections games will be in the tabs layout to navigate between games.

Have all the games organized on a main page.



## Optional Feature

If an open world game that requires collectibles, Agent can pull up interactive map that auto syncs your game with it every 10 seconds to keep it up on current info.
