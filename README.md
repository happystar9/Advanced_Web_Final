# Final Project - Proposal

 
## An elevator pitch of your project (something you can say in less than 1 minute)

The application will be for Satisfactory it will take in a material you want to create and output the possible recipes you can take to get this material


## The names of the contributors (if you are working with a partner)

None

## A rough list of features (this needs to be large enough to satisfy the "scope" requirements)
    
The agent will ask user permission to read save files to get the materials the user has

The agent will display different routes to achive the users input

The agent will reccommend the easiest route to follow

The agent will mark parts of routes done as you do them


## A list of new things you will need to do to accomplish your project (e.g. websockets)

Will need to learn how to have the AI read game save files and how to constrain it to not read any other files. 

Will need to learn how to keep the AI running in background to interactivly mark items as finished.



## Pages/ Views

Each route will be displayed on one template page but there will be tabs to switch between different routes to compare them.

The materials that the user has will be displayed on one page so the user can easily see all the materials they have to choose the route they want. 



## Optional Feature

Have the AI reccomend a setup to produce resources. Satisfactory has different rates for items so the AI can calculate efficient ways to get these items for you.
